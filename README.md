# Tennis-Analytics

Analysis of various tennis datasets. I've blogged about this [here](http://bmill42.github.io/blog/2021/01/30/tennis-predictions)

Because the majority of the data I use comes from elsewhere, I'm not uploading it directly. You can find the odds data [here](http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php), player data on [Jeff Sackman's github](https://github.com/JeffSackmann), and the match data either at those sources or from Kaggle.
